## Documentation:
  - The app will be build using Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
  - Backbone is used for models,collection manipulation, connect to API over RESTful json interface
  - Backbone.Marionette is used to organize the app in small views and for handling events.

##  Dependencies:
  - Framework environment
    + Backbone: http://backbonejs.org/
    + Backbone.Marionettejs: https://marionettejs.com/docs/v2.4.7 (UI) (you can update this to the last version if you want)
    + Jquery
  - Template
    + Handlebars: http://handlebarsjs.com/reference.html (recommended for building templating you can also use underscore)

  Use the following node module dependencies with npm:
  - run `npm install` to install the dependencies ( express, backbone, marionette, jquery)
  - install json-server, nodemon globaly.
    + `npm install json-server -g` (data-base server that stores in db.json the data and returns them based on xhr calls)
    + `npm install nodemon -g` (server)
  - run the following commands in the folder project on different terminal tabs
    + `nodemon server/server.js` to start server on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000)
    + `json-server --watch db.json` to start json server used for api calls (https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Implementation:
  - Implement the design template/style.
  - Make api calls to local db to render posts/comments
  - Filter post by 'topic_type'(discovery, social) when the buttons are clicked
  - Load just 10 post per call every time the user scrolls near the bottom of the page. Total posts -> 50
  - Load the comments of post by 'posts_id' when the user click the posts comment button
  - Try to show a specific ERROR message when there are no items (posts/comments) or when api error calls occur (!)

## Api Calls:
  - posts (http://localhost:3000/posts)
  - comments (http://localhost:3000/comments)

## UI style guide:
  - Newsfeed header bar must always be fixed on the window
  - Post comments will be opened using a slide-down animation
  - Reproduce the design provided as you interpret it
  - You can take (https://kuende.com) as an example

  (You can use Avocode (https://avocode.com/) to inspect the psd design)


Good Luck!
